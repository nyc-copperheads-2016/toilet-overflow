#Toilet Overflow's take on Stack Overflow.

*Members*: Arcangelo Petretta, Eric Shou, James Kirkpatrick, Jay Yee

###MVP User Stories:

1. Users should be able to post questions. Other users should be able to answer them. Users should be able to respond to both answers and questions. Like StackOverflow, the responses should just be a flat list.

2. The person who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers "the best."

3. Users should be able to vote on questions, answers, and responses (both upvotes and downvotes).

4. Users cannot add a question, answer, or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.

5. Users should be able to see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending."

6. Responses should be sorted chronologically, with oldest first. Answers should be sorted by "the best" first, followed by most highly-voted.
